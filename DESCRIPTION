Description: Bindings to Google's C++ library Compact Language Detector 2
    (see <https://github.com/cld2owners/cld2#readme> for more information). Probabilistically
    detects over 80 languages in plain text or HTML. For mixed-language input it returns the
    top three detected languages and their approximate proportion of the total classified 
    text bytes (e.g. 80% English and 20% French out of 1000 bytes). There is also a 'cld3'
    package on CRAN which uses a neural network model instead.
